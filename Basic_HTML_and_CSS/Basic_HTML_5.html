		<h1>Life is a Storm</h1>
		<p1>&#34;Life is a storm, my young friend. You will bask in the 	
		sunlight one moment, be shattered on the rocks the next. What makes 				you a man is what you do when that storm comes. You must look into that storm 			and shout as you did in Rome. Do your worst, for I will do mine! Then the fates 		will know you as we know you&#34; -Count of Monte Cristo</p>
